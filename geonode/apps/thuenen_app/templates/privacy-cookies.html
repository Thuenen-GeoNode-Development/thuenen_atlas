            with
            the legal regulations.

            data
            gathering. We do not use your data in order to trace you personally. The recipients of the data are only the

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>As with many websites, we use so-called “cookies”. Cookies are small text files which are transferred to your
            hard drive by a website server. By means of the cookies, we automatically receive certain data, such as the
            IP
            address, browser used, operating system in relation to your computer and connection to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>Cookies cannot be used to launch programs or transfer viruses onto a computer. On the basis of the
            information
            contained in cookies, we can make navigation easier and enable the correct display of our websites.
        </p>
        <p>Under no circumstances will the data gathered by us be passed on to third parties and no linkage with
            personal
            data will take place without your consent.</p>

        <h3>Server logfiles</h3>
        <p>Log file information is stored for security reasons (e.g. to investigate instances of misuse or fraud) for a
            short period of time and then deleted. Data that has to be retained for evidentiary purposes is excluded
            from
            erasure until the relevant incident has been fully resolved.</p>
        <p>The information generated by the cookie about your use of this internet service is saved on a server in
            Germany.</p>
        <p>The IP address will be anonymised immediately after processing and before it is saved. You can prevent the
            installation of cookies by changing the settings in your browser software. We wish to inform you that should
            you
            change your browser setting in this way, certain functions of this website may no longer be available.</p>
