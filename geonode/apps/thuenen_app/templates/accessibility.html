            (Ordinance on Accessible Information Technology) have only been partially met.
        </p>

            <li>Some of our PDF documents are accessible. Many documents are old documents. These documents cannot be

        <h2>Arbitration procedure</h2>
        <p>The Federal Government Commissioner for Matters relating to Disabled Persons has an arbitration service in
            accordance with Section 16 BGG. The arbitration service has the task of settling disputes between people
            with disabilities and federal public authorities. You can turn to the arbitration service, if you are not
            satisfied with the answers from the above contact option.
        </p>
        <p> It's not about finding winners or losers. Rather, the aim is to find a joint solution to a problem out of
            court with the help of the arbitration service.
        </p>
        <p>The arbitration procedure is free of charge. You also do not need legal assistance.
        </p>
        <p>You can find complete information about the arbitration procedure on the website of the arbitration service.
            There you can read about how an arbitration procedure works and how you can apply for arbitration. You can
            also submit the application in easy read or German sign language.
        </p>
